# My Application Name and description
-This web site is a a site for dogs using the thedogapi api site. The application starts by populating the dropdown with the dog breeds. Please note: the download limited me to 100 breeds. Then, the user selects a breed and clicks the "Submit" button. All photos available from the thedogapi (10 or less). 

The other feature is to select "Choose File". The user selects a dog photo and uploads it by clicking "Upload file" 

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
******* Note: if you reach my monthly quota of 5, then you get a 400 error when uploading a file. I put an alert message that says "Monthly upload quota to the dogapi was reached" if that is the case.
